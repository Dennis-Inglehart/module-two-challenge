# Professional Portfolio

## Portfolio of the Works of Dennis Inglehart

A simple, one-page website with internal links to contact and resume information, and external links to projects Dennis Inglehart worked on.

So far, most of the "project" links are arbitrary placeholders. The reason for this is that, for the page design to make any sense, more project links than actually exist were needed (i.e. more than 2 links).

The site is made with HTML and CSS, and behaves differently on different platforms, employing a "mobile first" design philosophy
